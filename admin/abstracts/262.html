<p>A pattern matching form which can operate on arbitrary Scheme
values is defined. It conforms to the following design
principles.</p>

<p>The syntax of patterns is declarative. The syntax is extensible
in the same way that Schemeâ€™s procedural syntax is extensible by
macros.</p>

<p>For most use cases, the use of the pattern matcher should
produce code which is essentially as efficient at run time as
equivalent procedural Scheme code would be, assuming a moderately
optimizing Scheme implementation. This applies only when the
equivalent code is also equivalently correct in terms of handling
of error cases (i.e.&nbsp;including all type checks done
automatically by the pattern matcher). However, using extension
syntax should not cause this principle to be violated (provided the
extension syntax is appropriately implemented).</p>
