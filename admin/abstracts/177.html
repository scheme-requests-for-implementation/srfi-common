<p>Many Scheme implementations have keyword arguments, but they
have not been widely standardized. This SRFI defines the macros
<code>lambda/kw</code> and <code>call/kw</code>. They can be used
identically in every major implementation currently in use,
making it safe to use keyword arguments in portable code. The
macros expand to native keyword arguments in Schemes that have
them, letting programmers mix portable code and
implementation-specific code.</p>
