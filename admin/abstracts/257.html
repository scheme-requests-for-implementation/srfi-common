Pattern matching extends Scheme's repertoire of conditional constructs, allowing
decomposition of compound data structures and binding their parts to variables.
This SRFI proposes one such construct, <code>match</code>, which provides all
common-denominator functionality described in <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-200/">SRFI-200</a>,
adding on top of it support for non-linear patterns and backtracking. Also, the
proposed construct is modular, and allows for convenient extension via the
<code>define-match-pattern</code> mechanism.
