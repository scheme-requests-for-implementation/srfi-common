Pattern matching extends Scheme's repertoire of conditional constructs, allowing
decomposition of compound data structures and binding their parts to variables.
This SRFI proposes one such construct, <code>match</code>, which offers all
the core functionality specified in <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-200/">SRFI 200</a>,
while extending it with support for non-linear patterns and backtracking.
The proposed construct is modular and supports easy extension through the <code>define-match-pattern</code>
mechanism. It can be implemented portably in R⁷RS-Small.</p>
