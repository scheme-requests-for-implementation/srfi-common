<p>This SRFI defines the procedure <code>generate-symbol</code>. Each
time it is invoked, the procedure returns a new symbol whose name
cannot be guessed. The returned symbol is a standard symbol for all
purposes; it obeys write/read invariance and it is equal to another
symbol if and only if their names are spelt the same.</p>
