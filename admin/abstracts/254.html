<p>This SRFI describes three concepts associated with the storage
  management of a Scheme system, <i>ephemerons</i>, <i>guardians</i>, and
<i>transport cell guardians</i>.</p>

<p>
  An ephemeron is a record structure with a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i> field.
  An ephemeron can be <i>broken</i>.  Breaking an ephemeron replaces the
  key and value with <code>#f</code>.  An implementation of this SRFI
  breaks an ephemeron when it proves that the storage occupied by
  the key could be reclaimed if the ephemeron were broken.
</p>

<p>
  A guardian is a structure containing objects as <i>guarded</i> or
  <i>resurrected</i> elements.  Initially, guardians are empty.
  Objects can be added in guarded elements to the guardian by the
  programmer.  An implementation of this SRFI resurrects an
  element when it proves that the storage occupied by
  the object could be reclaimed if all guardians in the system
  were empty.  Objects from resurrected elements can be queried
  and removed from the guardian by the programmer.  Instead of the
  object itself, a <i>representative</i> can be returned.
</p>

<p>
  A transport cell guardian is a structure containing <i>transport
    cells</i>, similar to a guardian.  Whenever an object in a
  guarded transport cell in the transport cell guardian is
  moved by the garbage collector, the transport cell is resurrected
  so that it can be queried by the programmer.
