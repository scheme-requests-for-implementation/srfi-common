  Continuation marks are a programming language feature that allows
  one to attach information to and retrieve information from
  continuations, generalizing stack inspection.  Conceptually, a
  continuation consists of a number of frames where each frame stands
  for an active procedure call that is not a tail call.  A
  continuation mark is then a key-value pair associated with a frame,
  with keys compared using <code>eq?</code>.
  At most one mark for a given key can be attached to a single frame.

  Besides stack inspection, continuation marks can be used to
  implement dynamic scope, delimited continuations, or delayed
  evaluation that is able to handle iterative lazy algorithms.

  This SRFI proposes to add continuation marks to the Scheme
  programming language.  The interface defined here is modelled after
  Racket's continuation marks.  It does not include all forms and
  procedures provided by Racket but provides a compatible subset.
