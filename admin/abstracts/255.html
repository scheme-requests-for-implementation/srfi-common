<p>When an exceptional situation is encountered by a program, it
usually creates a condition object describing the situation, and then
passes control to an exception handler. The
signaler and handler are two different parts of a system, between which
there is a barrier of abstraction. In order to recover gracefully and
flexibly from exceptional situations, however, the signaler can provide
multiple ways by which the handler can restart the computation, some of
which may require extra input. Often, the decision of which method of
recovery to choose is left up to a human user, who may be prompted for
the input needed to recover. This SRFI proposes a mechanism
called <dfn>restarters</dfn> which uses a new type of condition object
and an associated exception handler to encapsulate the information
necessary to restart a computation. We also
describe the behavior and interface of <dfn>interactor</dfn> procedures,
which implement interactive restarts.</p>
