<p>This SRFI defines a language to describe control-flow graphs
  (CFGs) suitable for formulating iterative and recursive
  algorithms.  Using the notion of a CFG term, this language can
  be seamlessly embedded in the Scheme language.  Complex CFG
  terms can be composed from simple CFG terms.</p>

<p>The language described in this SRFI is not meant to be directly
  used in programs but by library authors to build abstractions
  like loop facilities on top of it.</p>
