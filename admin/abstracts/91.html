      <p>This SRFI specifies an extension to the R5RS
      ports that supports several useful features: binary I/O and text I/O,
      bulk I/O, file opening attributes, and bidirectional ports. Binary I/O is
      provided through byte ports which are ports whose fundamental I/O unit is
      an 8 bit byte. Because characters can be encoded with bytes using a
      character encoding such as ISO 8859-1, UTF-8, and UTF-16BE, any byte port
      is also a character port (a port that supports the character level I/O of
      R5RS). A byte port's character encoding and various other attributes are
      specified when the port is opened. Because reasonable defaults exist,
      these attributes are specified using a named optional parameter syntax.
      All procedures which have the same name as in R5RS are compatible with
      R5RS but may provide additional functionality.
