      <p>The syntactic abstraction system described here
      extends the R5RS macro system with support for writing low-level macros
      in a high-level style, with automatic syntax checking, input
      destructuring, output restructuring, maintenance of lexical scoping and
      referential transparency (hygiene), and support for controlled identifier
      capture, with constant expansion overhead. Because it does not require
      literals, including quoted lists or vectors, to be copied or even
      traversed, it preserves sharing and cycles within and among the constants
      of a program. It also supports source-object correlation, i.e., the
      maintenance of ties between the original source code and expanded output,
      allowing implementations to provide source-level support for debuggers
      and other tools.
