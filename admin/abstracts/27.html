      <p>This document specifies an interface to sources
      of random bits, or "random sources" for brevity. In particular, there are
      three different ways to use the interface, with varying demands on the
      quality of the source and the amount of control over the production
      process:
      <ul>
        <li>The "no fuss" interface specifies that
        <code>(random-integer</code> <i>n</i><code>)</code> produces the next
        random integer in {0, ..., <i>n</i>-1} and <code>(random-real)</code>
        produces the next random real number between zero and one. The details
        of how these random values are produced may not be very relevant, as
        long as they appear to be sufficiently random.
        <li>For simulation purposes, on the contrary, it
        is usually necessary to know that the numbers are produced
        deterministically by a pseudo random number generator of high quality
        and to have explicit access to its state. In addition, one might want
        to use several independent sources of random numbers at the same time
        and it can be useful to have some simple form of randomization.
        <li>For security applications a serious form of
        true randomization is essential, in the sense that it is difficult for
        an adversary to exploit or introduce imperfections into the
        distribution of random bits. Moreover, the linear complexity of the
        stream of random bits is more important than its statistical
        properties. In these applications, an entropy source (producing truely
        random bits at a low rate) is used to randomize a pseudo random number
        generator to increase the rate of available bits.
      </ul>
      <p>Once random sources provide the infrastructure
      to obtain random bits, these can be used to construct other random
      deviates. Most important are floating point numbers of various
      distributions and random discrete structures, such as permutations or
      graphs. As there is an essentially unlimited number of such objects (with
      limited use elsewhere), we do not include them in this SRFI. In other
      words, this SRFI is <em>not</em> about making all sorts of random
      objects---it is about obtaining random bits in a portable, flexible,
      reliable, and efficient way.
