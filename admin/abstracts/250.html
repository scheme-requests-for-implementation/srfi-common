<p>This SRFI defines an interface to hash tables, which are widely
recognized as a fundamental data structure for a wide variety of
applications.  A hash table is a data structure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is disjoint from all other types.</li>
  <li>Provides a mapping from objects known as <dfn>keys</dfn>
    to corresponding objects known as <dfn>values</dfn>.
    <ul>
      <li>Keys may be any Scheme objects in some kinds of hash tables,
        but are restricted in other kinds.</li>
      <li>Values may be any Scheme objects.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Provides an <dfn>equality predicate</dfn> which defines
    when a proposed key is the same as an existing key.  No table
    may contain more than one value for a given key.</li>
  <li>Provides a <dfn>hash function</dfn> which maps a candidate
    key into a non-negative exact integer.</li>
  <li>Supports mutation as the primary means of setting the
    contents of a table.</li>
  <li>Provides key lookup and destructive update in (expected)
    amortized constant time, provided that a satisfactory hash
    function is available.</li>
  <li>Does not guarantee that whole-table operations work in
    the presence of concurrent mutation of the whole hash table.
    (Values may be safely mutated.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike the hash tables of <a
href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-125/">SRFI 125</a>, which is the
direct ancestor of this specification, the hash tables described here
are ordered by insertion: that is, associations inserted earlier in
the history of the hash table appear earlier in the ordering. Advances
in the implementations of hash tables, as provided by C++, Python,
JavaScript, etc., make the provision of this new facility practical.
As a result, the hash tables of this SRFI do not necessarily
interoperate with the hash tables of SRFI 125, <a
href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-126/">SRFI 126</a>, or existing
R6RS implementations.</p>
