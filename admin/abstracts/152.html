      <p>Scheme has an impoverished set of
      string-processing utilities, which is a problem for authors of portable
      code. This SRFI proposes a coherent and comprehensive set of
      string-processing procedures. It is a reduced version of SRFI 13 that has
      been aligned with SRFI 135, Immutable Texts. Unlike SRFI 13, it has been
      made consistent with the R5RS, R6RS, and R7RS-small string
      procedures.
