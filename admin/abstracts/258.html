    <p>An uninterned symbol is not the same as any other symbol, even one
    with the same name. These symbols are useful in macro programming and
    in other situations where guaranteed-unique names are needed.
    A survey of uninterned and uniquely named symbols
    in Scheme is also provided.</p>
