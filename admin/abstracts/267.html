    Raw string syntax are lexical syntax for strings that do not interpret escapes
    inside of them. They are useful in cases where the string data has a lot of
    characters like <code>\</code> or <code>&quot;</code> that would otherwise have to
    be escaped. The raw string syntax in this document is derived from C++11's raw
    string literals.
