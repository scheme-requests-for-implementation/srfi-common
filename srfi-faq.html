    <h1><a href="/"><img class="srfi-logo" src="srfi-logo.svg" alt="SRFI surfboard logo" /></a>Scheme
      Request For Implementation - FAQ</h1>

  <p>The <em>Scheme Request for Implementation</em> process is
    <a href= "srfi-process.html">documented elsewhere</a>.  This
    document is intended to provide some of the rationale about SRFIs
    rather than cluttering up that document.</p>

  <p>The SRFI process grew out of the Scheme Workshop held in
    Baltimore, MD, on September 26, 1998, where the attendees
    considered a number of proposals for standardized feature sets
    for inclusion in Scheme implementations.  Many of the proposals
    received overwhelming support in a series of straw votes.  Along
    with this there was concern that the next Revised Report would
    not be produced for several years and this would prevent the
    timely implementation of standardized approaches to several
    important problems and needs in the Scheme community.</p>

  <p>The SRFI process is a service provided to the Scheme community by
    the editors, currently Arthur A. Gleckler.  See <a
    href="srfi-history.html">SRFI History</a> for information on the
    previous editors.  As of July, 2015, SRFI is hosted on <a
    href="http://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-announce/msg/2736115">new
    mail and web hosts</a>.  (See the new <a
    href="hosting-plan.html">Hosting Plan</a>.)</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Are SRFIs standards?

    <dd>
      <p>Yes and no.  SRFIs are <strong>not</strong> official
	standards.  There exist organizations such as ISO, IEEE, ANSI,
	etc. who are set up to develop official standards.  The SRFI
	process is designed as an attempt to maximize the quality of
	SRFIs within the constraint of not assigning authority to
	anyone.</p>

      <p>There are official Scheme standards, ANSI Scheme and
	IEEE-1178-1990.  SRFIs are in addition to these standards.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the process for creating SRFIs
	<strong>is</strong> standardized, and each final SRFI remains
	frozen and publicly available, hence they have many of the
	properties of standards.  So you might choose to think of them
	as unofficial standards.</p>

    <dt>Are SRFIs replacements for R<sup>n</sup>RS?

    <dd>
      <p>No.  Each Revised Report has been written by a different body,
	which determines what eventually is and is not included in
	that report.  The SRFI process is orthogonal to all of these
	reports.  Authors of SRFIs must not expect that their SRFIs
	will be included, or even be considered, by the authors of
	reports.</p>

      <p>Of course anyone, including authors of future Revised
	Reports, is welcome to employ the definition and rationale of
	a SRFI, the discussion surrounding its adoption, and its
	widespread implementation to argue that the authors of a
	standard or report should consider adding the contents of the
	SRFI to that standard.</p>

      <p>If SRFIs had existed before R<sup>4</sup>RS, the macro
	appendix to that report might have made more sense to have
	been released as a SRFI.  But it didn't.  So it wasn't.</p>

      <p>There is <strong>considerable</strong> value in reading
	the <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/rrrs-archive.html">discussions of the R<sup>n</sup>RS authors</a>, as they have often
	considered issues that are candidates for SRFIs.</p>

    <dt><a id="preliminary">Are SRFIs a discussion forum for
    preliminary ideas?</a>

    <dd>
      <p>No.  SRFIs stands for <em>Scheme Request for
	Implementation</em>.  Note the last word.  If someone has
	amorphous ideas for something that would be cool, but has no
	idea how it might be done, they should discuss it in journals,
	workshops, seminars, or public forums
	like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scheme/">r/scheme</a>
	on Reddit.  When the discussions have coalesced to the point
	where an implementation strategy is apparent, then it is time
	to write up a SRFI proposal.</p>

    <dt>I really think that there should be a place to archive
    non-implementation documents.

    <dd>
      <p>You're not alone!  There seem to be lots of people who
	disagree with the editors on this point.  If you have ideas on how
	this should be done, please send mail to
	<a href="mailto:srfi-editors%20at%20srfi%20dot%20schemers%20dot%20org">&lt;srfi
	minus editors at srfi dot schemers dot org&gt;</a></p>

    <dt>Are SRFIs "RFCs for the Scheme community?"

    <dd>
      <p>Not quite.  As RFC1796 (<a href=
        "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1796">Not All RFCs are
	Standards</a>) says, RFCs serve a variety of purposes.  The SRFI
	editors feel that there are sufficient other venues for
	discussion of ideas.  The point of SRFIs is that a programmer
	can dependably test to see what features a Scheme
	implementation provides, and can therefore program in a
	portable way beyond the bounds of standardized Scheme.</p>

    <dt>What's with all the time periods?  Why so little
    time?

    <dd>
      <p>The time periods are an attempt to drive the SRFI process as
	quickly as possible while maintaining sufficient time for
	sober second thought.  To maximize the quality of SRFIs, we
	want all of the relevant people to be involved in the
	discussion of any particular SRFI proposal.  Many of those
	people are very busy, and this mechanism constrains the time
	commitment they must make to stay on top of a proposal.  It
	also prevents discussion on a proposal from dragging on in an
	endless repetition of the same points, long after anyone's
	opinion is likely to be changed.</p>

      <p>The other issue in the timing is to prevent editors from
	stone-walling a proposal.  It is not their job to make
	qualitative judgments about proposals, but rather to maintain
	the quality while expediting the creation of important
	unofficial standards.</p>

      <p>If a proposal is still under discussion after 90 days, it
	means that it has been extended several times.  The editors
	will normally extend the discussion period to maintain a
	minimum of 15 days after any significant change.  Any proposal
	still under active discussion and revision after 90 days is
	not ready for codification.  It will then be withdrawn for a
	(normal) minimum of 30 days, after which it may be
	resubmitted.  If it is now in good shape, it will likely
	become final after the 60-day discussion period.  Thus, it
	will have been delayed a maximum of 90 days.  This is likely
	to happen only in very exceptional cases, and is the only
	cost of the fixed time periods.</p>

    <dt><a id="teeth">What kind of standards are these,
    anyway?  There aren't any teeth in the rules!</a>

    <dd>
      <p>To have enforcement, there must be authority.  There is no
	absolute authority in the Scheme community, so there can be no
	absolute enforcement.  The final authority is the implementors.
	If they believe that a particular SRFI documents a useful or
	important feature, they will add it to their implementations;
	if not, they won't.  The discussion relating to any SRFI will be
	retained indefinitely, and implementors can refer to that when
	making their decision.  Hence poorly worded, poorly reasoned, or
	poorly defended SRFIs will be nothing more than a waste of
	some time &mdash; regrettable, but necessary to retain an open
	process.</p>

    <dt>Why do I have to include a sample implementation?

    <dd>
      <p>See the discussion above about <a href=
        "#preliminary">preliminary ideas</a>.  SRFIs are about
	implementation.  If you haven't either: (a) built one, or (b)
	have a very clear outline of how to build one, then you aren't
	documenting anything useful about implementation.  As the
	<a href="srfi-process.html">process document</a> says, if you
	think the editors are wrong to withdraw your proposal because
	it doesn't have a sufficient outline of implementation, then
	prove us wrong by going and implementing it on some system.  Then
	your SRFI will return to draft, and eventually active
	status.</p>

    <dt>What standard should my sample implementation use?

    <dd>
      <p>We encourage contributors to use R<sup>7</sup>RS combined with other
	SRFIs as a basis.  However, some SRFIs will require features not
	present in R<sup>7</sup>RS and other SRFIs, and that's okay.
	Furthermore, using other R<sup>n</sup>RS standards, as well as
        IEEE Scheme, is acceptable.</p>

    <dt>What should my sample implementation include?

    <dd>
      <p>It should implement all the features described in the SRFI
	document.</p>

      <p>It should also include automated tests.  Having them will
	help implementors, and that will increase the likelihood that
	your SRFI will be incorporated in Scheme implementations.  It
	will also help users understand how your SRFI is to be used.

      <p>However, if the sample implementation is trivial or not
	really meant to be used, i.e. it is just a proof of concept,
	it's okay to omit tests.  That should be a rare case.

      <p>No specific test framework is required, but both SRFI 64 and
	SRFI 78 are available.

    <dt>Do SRFIs exist to describe the features of a particular
    Scheme implementation?

    <dd>
      <p>No.  Every SRFI should describe a cohesive feature set that is
	portable across a variety of Scheme implementations.  (Here we
	mean portable in the sense of being possible to implement,
	not in the sense of a portable implementation.) Rather than
	testing to see if the implementation is, e.g. Guile-4.3c, a
	program should test for the particular features that it
	requires.</p>

      <p>This is a lesson learned from the Emacs world where it
	used to be that code would check to see what version of Emacs
	it was running on and make assumptions about the features
	that that particular version provided.  Unfortunately, that
	made the code un-portable to alternative Emacs
	implementations that had the required features but different
	version numbers.  The same lesson can be observed in
	old C code that assumed that such-and-such a system had
	particular features.  More commonly today, C programs use a
	configuration program that determines what libraries and
	functions are available, regardless of the system or
	compiler.  The mechanism documented in <a href="srfi-7/">SRFI
	7</a> essentially provides a similar capability, while
	staying within Scheme code.</p>

      <p>The biggest advantage of checking for features rather than
	implementations is that code becomes portable to systems of
	which the author was unaware, assuming that they provide the features
	that the program requires.</p>

    <dt>
      <p>The process document mentions that different SRFIs may
	conflict with each other.  Won't that make it impossible for an
	implementation to support conflicting SRFIs?</p>

    <dd>Not necessarily.  See <a href="/srfi-7/">SRFI 7</a>.
    <a id="copyright"></a>

    <dt>Does the SRFI copyright permit using a SRFI sample
    implementation (or a derivative of one) in my Scheme
    implementation?

    <dd><p>Yes.</p>

    <dt>Does the SRFI copyright permit using parts of a SRFI in
    the documentation of my Scheme implementation?

    <dd><p>Yes.</p>

    <dt>Where did the acronym come from?  It's a mouthful.

    <dd>
      <p>Alan Bawden suggested RFI at the Scheme workshop as a
	humorous reference to RFCs.  The S was added because the initial
	editors (and others) felt that "Scheme" should be in there
	somewhere.  If you pronounce it <em>ess-are-eff-eye</em> it certainly
	is a mouthful, but if you pronounce it <em>surfie</em>, as we do,
	it's fine.  Scheme Implementation Request (SIR) was also
	proposed.</p>

    <dt>Are there any special considerations if I use Github to
    propose or comment on a SRFI?

    <dd>
      <p>Please keep the discussion of each SRFI on its mailing
	list.  For example, if you create a pull request, send all your
	comments to the mailing list.  While Github's tools can be
	convenient, we don't want to lose any of our history to Github.
	While their APIs make it straightforward to download almost
	everything (e.g. comments, issues, and pull requests), we don't
	have code in place to do that automatically.</p>

    <dt>What if I don't want to use Github?

    <dd>
      <p>If you'd rather not use Github to propose SRFIs or
	revisions to them, feel free to point the editors at alternate
	Git repos or to send us patch files.  (Patch files can be
	created using <code>git format-patch -M origin/master</code> or
	<code>git send-email</code>.) If you're a SRFI author and
	would rather not use Git, either, just send updated files, or
	links to them, or diffs, and we'll check in the changes.</p>

    <dt>May I use Markdown or another format?

    <dd>
      <p>You may include a Markdown version, but you must still submit
	the SRFI document as HTML.</p>

      <p>Below is a snippet from the <code>Makefile</code> of SRFI 123.
	It generates HTML from Markdown using the Pandoc tool (GPL
	licensed).

      <pre>
      srfi-123.html: srfi-123.md
	pandoc \
	  --css=http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi.css \
	  --from=markdown_github-hard_line_breaks \
	  --include-in-header=header.html \
	  --standalone \
	  --to=html \
	  srfi-123.md \
	  >srfi-123.html
      </pre>

      <p>Remember that the editors need to make slight changes to the
	document, e.g. to add to its history of drafts, and won't edit
	the document in a format other than HTML.</p>

    <dt id="conventions">What linguistic conventions do SRFIs use?

    <dd>
      <p>Starting in about 2019, new SRFIs use some of the conventions
	of the R7RS Small report
	(<a href="https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf">PDF</a>),
	section 1.3.2, a shortened form of which appears here.  Note
	that SRFIs before about 2019 may not follow these conventions.</p>

      <p>When speaking of an error situation, we use the phrase “an
	error is signaled” to indicate that implementations must
	detect and report the error by raising a non-continuable
	exception, as if by the procedure <code>raise</code>.  The
	phrase “an error that satisfies <i>predicate</i> is signaled”
	means that an error is signaled as above.  Furthermore, if the
	object that is signaled is passed to the specified predicate,
	the predicate returns <code>#t</code>.</p>

      <p>The phrase "is an error," however, means that implementations
	are not required to detect or report the error.  In fact, the
	implementation may take any action whatsoever, such as
	signaling an error, extending a procedure’s behavior, or
	failing catastrophically.  If the value of an expression is
	said to be “unspecified,” then the expression must evaluate to
	some object without signaling an error, but the value depends
	on the implementation.</p>

      <p>Finally, the words and phrases “must,” “must not,” “shall,”
	“shall not,” “should,” “should not,” “may,” “required,”
	“recommended,” and “optional" are to be interpreted as
	described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.html">RFC
	2119</a> unless otherwise specified.  They are used only with
	reference to implementer or implementation behavior, not with
	reference to programmer or program behavior.</p></dd>

    <dt>May I contribute code to a final SRFI, e.g. an implementation
      of the SRFI for a specific Scheme implementation?

    <dd>
      <p>We are happy to accept contributions.  We'll publish your code in
	the SRFI's Git repository.  Please
	include a <code>README</code> file, and use the copyright notice
	from the <a href="srfi-process.html">SRFI process</a>.</p>

    <dt>Whom should I contact if I find a problem with the web site, etc?
